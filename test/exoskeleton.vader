" Tests to write later... I'm sorry TDD :(
" - Test the augroups are fired when we create a new buffer
" - Test anything with the extension .exo.* is given an exoskeleton filetype
" - Test we convert an-exoskeleton-path into/a/normal/one
" - Test a multiline template
" - Test a single line with two templates on it
