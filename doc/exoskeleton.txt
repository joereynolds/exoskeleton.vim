exoskeleton - Skeleton improved!

INTRODUCTION                                                        *exoskeleton*

A plugin providing skeleton-like templating, embedding
of vimscript, and support for custom directories.


===============================================================================
1. Global Options                                           *exoskeleton-options*

`g:exoskeleton_base_directory`
(default '~/.vim/exoskeleton/')

    The base directory where exoskeleton templates are stored.

    `let g:exoskeleton_base_directory = '/home/john/custom/directory'`

===============================================================================
2. Templates                                              *exoskeleton-templates*

Templates for exoskeleton are stored in two places.

Assuming the base directory of skeleton is the default,
they are stored in
    `~/.vim/exoskeleton/ft`
and
    `~/.vim/exoskeleton/place`

FT TEMPLATES                                                     *exoskeleton-ft*

An ft template is a file stored in the `ft` directory of exoskeleton
(~/.vim/skeleton).

Storing a file in here will be immediately evaluated when a file of that type
is created.

i.e. If we have the following file:

    `~/.vim/exoskeleton/ft/exoskeleton.vim`

Any `.vim` file created will contain the contents, and evaluated vimscript of `exoskeleton.vim`.

Note that the filename can be anything, only the file extension is important.


PLACE TEMPLATES                                               *exoskeleton-place*

A place template is a template dependent on directory rather than filetype.
A place template is an `exoskeleton` file inside the `place` directory of
exoskeleton (~/.vim/exoskeleton/place). It needs to be mapped to
the directory you wish to apply it to via the filename.

i.e. If we want to always insert a template in ~/code/models/

We would create the following file:

    `~/.vim/exoskeleton/place/home-joe-code-models/exoskeleton`

Any file created within `~/code/models/` will now contain the contents and
evaluated vimscript of the `exoskeleton` file.
